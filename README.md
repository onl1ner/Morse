## About project 
**Morse** â€“ English to Morse code translator written in `SwiftUI` for [Swift Student Challenge '22](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/). The application can translate texts of any size and complexity. One of the main features of application is that you can look at the translation for each word in the translated sentence. You can also listen to how your sentence would sound on the telegraph.

Originally, application was designed to be only for iPad, as it was written on it, but thanks to the cross-platform nature of the `SwiftUI` framework, the application is also available for installation on iPhone.
